								<p><b>Social Learning and Behavioral Plasticity in Multi-Agent Robot Systems through Reinforcement Learning and Embodied Evolution</b> <br>
									A key objective in artificial intelligence and robotics is to develop systems capable of autonomous decision-making and adaptation
									to dynamic environments. Evolutionary robotics, a sub-field of robotics, aims to achieve this by drawing inspiration from natural
									evolution and applying principles of gene selection and variation within robots to enable adaptation. Embodied evolution, a subset
									of evolutionary robotics, distinguishes itself from other evolutionary algorithms by distributing control among the robots rather
									than centrally, allowing for asynchronous, autonomous, and continuous evolution. Reinforcement learning is a method for agents to
									learn autonomously based on trial-and-error learning. Researchers suggest that combining reinforcement learning with embodied evolution
									may enhance robotic collectives' adaptability in dynamic settings, an idea inspired by studies of behavioral plasticity and social
									learning in animal populations. This research takes an essential step toward testing these ideas in physical systems rather than
									simulations, which are commonly used but fail to address many real-world complexities. Using TurtleBot3 robots equipped with Raspberry
									Pi 4 and 5 modules, this work involved constructing the robots, equipping them with hardware, and setting up ROS 2 as a foundational
									environment for implementing reinforcement learning and embodied evolution. While the theoretical algorithms remain to be tested, this
									groundwork is crucial for transitioning these concepts from simulation to reality. The emphasis on physical deployment ensures that the
									challenges and nuances of real-world applications, often overlooked in simulation, are addressed, paving the way for adaptive robotic
									systems with greater practical utility.</p>
